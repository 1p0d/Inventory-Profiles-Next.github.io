# Changelog

### 0.8.5
- Fixed problem in Forge mods that made sorting impossible if the inventory/container has more than 1 enchanted item with same enchants, same item type, and same name and items were arranged in specific way.
- Added hotkey for reloading the mod configurations. It's recommended that it's only used while defining new custom rules and kept unset in other situations.

### 0.8.4
- Fixes locked slots behaviour when changing dimensions/worlds. There is new config that allows the user to control how many client ticks need to pass before the locked slot keeper is reinitialised on dimension/world change. This wait is necessary because the inventory might be empty when the player is spawned in the new dimension/world and we need to wait to receive the inventory content from the server.

### 0.8.3
- Now on servers also items will not be picked into empty locked slots. NOTE! Doesn't work while inventory is open. It's not possible to distinguish between player moving items and server initiated changes.
- Added configuration to disable mod buttons on non-vanilla screens. For better compatibility with othe mods

### 0.8.2
- Added per server locked slots. Enabled by default. Can be disabled in the configuration.

### 0.8.1
- Added support for single click/press inventory throw. Hotkey can be configured in Hotkeys. Disabled by default. This obeys the same rules for hotbar as "move all". 
- Fixed Shift+Click Ctrl+Q skipping locked slots to work on servers. 
- Clarified, in the tooltip, that not picking up items in locked slots works only in single player. Support for servers will require service side mod.
- We now have a discord server **[![2][2]][1]**

### 0.8.0
- Shift+Click Ctrl+Q can now be disabled and enabled (default) for locked slots. This also applies for swipe variant of the actions.
- SINGLE PLAYER ONLY. Items will not be picked into empty locked slots
