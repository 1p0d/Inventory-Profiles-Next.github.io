# Known issues

- When UI scaling is more than 2 or in case of tiny game windows the config screen might not show the anchor header correctly.
- If you make the game window 0x0 pixels while the configuration screen is open, sometimes the game crashes.

## Known Issues in Forge 1.17.1 due to missing MixIn support

- Preventing swipe moving of locked slots doesn't work.
- Preventing item pickups in empty locked slots falls back to the server method i.e. items are picked into the inventory and then thrown out.
