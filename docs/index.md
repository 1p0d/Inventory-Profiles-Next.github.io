This mod will:

- Help you keep your inventory sorted
- Replace your quasi-broken tool
- Dump everything in that chest with one click
- Move the items you have that are also already in the chest                                           
- Lock item slots in place so that sorting ignores them
- Keep locked slots empty
- Allow you to press R+C to set your shortcuts
- Be pure client-side, so that it works everywhere
